# Algorithms-And-Data-Structures

In this GitHub repo I am going to cover algorithms and data structures.
You can find their runtime in the code comments. See when is it better to use specific type of algorithm according to the scenarios I have covered in this repo.

The material is not finished, it is ongoing and I will try to add more and more algorithms and information as soon as possible.
